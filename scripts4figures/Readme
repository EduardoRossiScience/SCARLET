This folder contains a series of subfolders conceived to re-generate the figures attached to the submitted paper to GMD. 
The user should read first the instructions contained inside the txt file contained inside each folder.
Some of the figures require several time and a good cluster in order to be ultimated. The computatinal process can be speed up reducing the number of loops
contained in some of the scripts.
